# So, why did I create this?
 I created this to share my files and images publicly for free. Also for direction problems when making other repos due to the shoban-chiddarth.github.io domain and the repo name, so when I point something with "./" or "//" or "/" it won't point to the place that it did in the code editor. So I will upload files here and paste the link there. Now you can cancel the posting of this issue and close this window.
